1. Positional Conservation Class and SAV Effect Score Plot
The x-axis is the position in the MSA aligned natural and generated sequences, y-axis is the Average conservation class for natural sequences per position and the Average SAV effect score for generated sequences per position. 
  
2. Conservation Class vs SAV Effect Relation: 
The y-axis is the Average Conservation Class of each position in wildtype sequences and the x-axis is the Average SAV Effect Score of each position in generated sequences. 
  So for each MSA position the y value represents the Average conservation class of this position in wildtype sequences and the x value represents the Average SAV effect of mutations introduced in this position in the generated sequences. 
  A linear regression equation shows the relation between the two variables; the relation can be negative or positive according to the slope. 
  Also Spearman correlation is calculated for both variables. 
  Good generated data should have inverse correlation as mutations introduced to evolutionary conserved regions should have low effect since these regions are crucial for the proteinâ€™s function and stability
